# Privacy Policy for Lockpaper

**Effective Date:** May 29, 2024

Thank you for using Lockpaper ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App. Lockpaper is designed with your privacy as a core principle.

**1. Information We Do Not Collect**

Lockpaper **does not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) about you or your device usage. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Your name, email address, or other contact information.
    * Your device identifiers, location data, or IP address.
    * Usage analytics or crash reports (unless a future version explicitly adds opt-in crash reporting).

**2. Information You Provide (Stored Locally)**

The only data the App handles is the content of the notes you create (titles and bodies). This data is:
    * Stored **exclusively on your device's local storage**.
    * **Never** transmitted off your device by the App's core functionality.

**3. Data Storage and Security**

Your notes are stored within an encrypted database on your device using **SQLCipher (AES-256 encryption)**. Access to the App and its data is protected by:
    * A mandatory **App Lock** screen requiring your device's biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition) or a PIN code you set up.
    * The underlying database encryption key, which is securely stored in your device's hardware-backed secure storage (via `flutter_secure_storage`) and is only loaded into memory when the App is actively unlocked.

**4. Third-Party Services**

Lockpaper does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services. The core functionality of the App operates entirely offline and does not require network permissions.

**5. Children's Privacy**

Lockpaper does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). The App's functionality is not directed at children.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version accessible through the App's listing on the Google Play Store. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
